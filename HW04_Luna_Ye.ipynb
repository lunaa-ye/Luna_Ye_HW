    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Interactions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Difference Between Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - We discussed that **standard deviation** measures the variability of individual data points around the mean of a dataset, while the **standard error of the mean (SEM)** measures the variability of sample means around the population mean. SEM is smaller than standard deviation because it decreases with larger sample sizes, reflecting the increased accuracy of the sample mean as an estimator of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Explanation of Standard Error of the Mean:**\n",
    "   - I clarified that the SEM represents how much the sample means deviate from the true population mean, providing insight into how reliable the sample mean is as an estimate of the population mean. We also discussed the connection between sample size and SEM: larger sample sizes lead to smaller SEMs, indicating more precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Standard Deviation as a Descriptive Statistic:**\n",
    "   - We reviewed that **standard deviation** is a descriptive statistic because it summarizes the spread or variability in a dataset. It helps describe how much individual data points deviate from the mean, giving an understanding of the distribution of values within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Creating Confidence Intervals Using the SEM:**\n",
    "   - I walked you through the steps to calculate a confidence interval using the SEM. For a 95% confidence interval, we use the formula \\(\\bar{x} \\pm z \\cdot \\text{SEM}\\), where \\(z = 1.96\\) for a 95% confidence level. We discussed how to compute the SEM, the margin of error, and how to use these to determine the bounds of the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Bootstrapped Confidence Interval Using SEM:**\n",
    "   - We explored how to create a 95% confidence interval from the distribution of bootstrapped sample means using the standard error of the bootstrapped means. The process involved calculating the SEM from the bootstrapped means and applying the formula \\(\\bar{x} \\pm z \\cdot \\text{SEM}\\) to find the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Bootstrapped Confidence Interval Using the Percentile Method:**\n",
    "   - Alternatively, we reviewed the **percentile method** for constructing a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval without using the standard deviation. This method involves:\n",
    "     1. Generating a large number of bootstrap samples.\n",
    "     2. Sorting the bootstrapped sample means.\n",
    "     3. Finding the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the sorted bootstrap means.\n",
    "     4. Using these percentiles as the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "   - This method is non-parametric and doesn’t require the assumption of normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Explanation of `np.quantile` and Its Use in Bootstrapping:**\n",
    "   - We discussed how **`np.quantile`** in NumPy can be used to calculate quantiles from a dataset, making it ideal for finding the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrapped sample means to create a confidence interval. The function is efficient and well-suited for bootstrapping since it directly computes the quantiles without requiring additional calculations like standard deviation or SEM.\n",

The variability of the sample statistic due to sampling is key to understanding the uncertainty in estimating the population parameter. Confidence intervals provide a range that likely contains the true population parameter, quantifying the uncertainty around the sample statistic.\n",

    "   - **Role of Sample Statistics**: They provide the basis for making inferences about population parameters, allowing us to calculate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing.\n",

    "To rephrase the question, we can say that we have hypothesis that the average of some population is 50. But what we got is only a sample of size n, and we're wondering if 50 is a resonable guess based on the sample.\n",
    "<br>We can start by generating bootstrap samples following the steps described in the answer to Question 6.1. From our original sample of size n, we repeatedly draw randam data points with replacement to create lots of new samples. We calculate the average of each one of the new samples. After that, we can look at the distribution of these averages. If these averages mostly hang around 50, then our hypothesized guess could be plausible. But if 50 looks way outside the typical range of our bootstrapped averages, that could mean our guess isn’t quite right.\n"

    "### 1. **What is Bootstrapping?**\n",
    "   - Bootstrapping is a resampling method used to estimate the distribution of a statistic by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. It allows the estimation of variability (like standard errors or confidence intervals) when the underlying distribution is unknown or when the sample size is small.\n",
    "   - The process involves:\n",
    "     1. Drawing multiple bootstrap samples (with replacement) from the original sample.\n",
    "     2. Calculating the statistic of interest for each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "     3. Repeating this many times to generate a bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "     4. Using the distribution to estimate confidence intervals, standard errors, or perform hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Main Purpose of Bootstrapping**\n",
    "   - The main purpose of bootstrapping is to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic without making strong parametric assumptions about the population. It helps to:\n",
    "     - Estimate standard errors.\n",
    "     - Construct confidence intervals.\n",
    "     - Perform hypothesis testing.\n",
    "     - Validate models in predictive contexts.\n",
    "     - Handle small sample sizes where traditional methods may be unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using Bootstrapping to Test a Hypothesis about the Population Mean**\n",
    "   - If you have a hypothesized population mean and a sample, bootstrapping can help assess whether your hypothesis is plausible:\n",
    "     1. Generate bootstrap samples from the original sample.\n",
    "     2. Calculate the sample mean for each bootstrap sample.\n",
    "     3. Construct a confidence interval for the mean from the bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "     4. Check if the hypothesized mean falls within this interval.\n",
    "   - If the hypothesized mean is within the confidence interval, it's considered plausible. If not, the data suggests the hypothesized mean might not be valid.\n",

    "The confidence interval is bounded by mean of bootstrap sample means +- margin of error instead of a single data point of the mean of bootstrap sample means. When determining whether to reject the null hypothesis, we are using the confidence interval to estimate rather than the observed sample mean statistic. \n",
    "<br> The null hypothesis (e.g., 𝐻0: 𝜇=0) claims that the true population parameter is zero. A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the parameter based on the sample data. If zero is within this range, the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, meaning the sample does not provide strong evidence to contradict it.\n",
    "<br>Even if the sample mean is not zero, if the confidence interval includes zero, there’s a chance the true population mean could still be zero. Therefore, the data do not offer enough evidence to definitively reject 𝐻0.\n",
    "<br>To reject the null hypothesis, the confidence interval must not include zero. This means the entire range of plausible values for the parameter lies either entirely above or below zero, indicating that the true population parameter is likely different from zero. This would provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading you to reject it."

    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Vaccine Data Analysis Overview**  \n",
    "You are working on a vaccine data analysis assignment for AliTech, where you aim to determine whether the vaccine improves patients' health scores using bootstrapping and hypothesis testing. The dataset includes patients' initial and final health scores, with deliverables focused on:\n",
    "- Data visualization\n",
    "- Quantitative analysis\n",
    "- Null hypothesis testing (no effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Steps to Create and Read CSV Files**  \n",
    "You were provided guidance on how to:\n",
    "- Create a CSV file containing the vaccine data manually or programmatically using Python and the `pandas` library.\n",
    "- Read the CSV file into Python for analysis using `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Quantitative Analysis Explanation**  \n",
    "Quantitative analysis was explained as the process of analyzing measurable and numerical data, in this case, the difference between initial and final health scores. You will use statistical techniques like bootstrapping to generate a confidence interval and perform hypothesis testing to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Statistical Results Interpretation**  \n",
    "You were presented with statistical results:\n",
    "- **95% Confidence Interval**: [0.7, 5.5]  \n",
    "   This indicates that the true mean difference in health scores lies between 0.7 and 5.5, suggesting a significant positive effect of the vaccine.\n",
